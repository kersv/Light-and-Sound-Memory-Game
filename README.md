## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I have not used any outside resources to help complete this submission, only what was given from the guide.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
One challenge I had while doing working on this game was understanding the usage from html id and actions being used in script.js. I am quite new to JavaScript but I have worked with Java before and C++ and functions syntax were not too far apart.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
A question I have is that I see we use JavaScript built-in function, is that used very often in other projects or does it depends on the task at hand?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If i had a few more hours to work on this project, I would have the sequence be randomized sequence instead of having a set sequence. I would also increase the size of the array by double atleast to make it more challenging. To make it even more challenging, after every sequence it will randomize the positioning of the buttons. For example, Green swaps with blue and pink swaps with yellow.
